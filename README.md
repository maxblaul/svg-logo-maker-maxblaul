## Description 

This is a Node.js application that allows you to create SVG logos with customizable shapes, colors, and text. The application makes use of the inquirer library for user interaction and the fs library for file I/O. It also includes a module that defines three basic shapes: Triangle, Square, and Circle, which can be chosen for your own personal logo.

## Installation

You may install the files by cloning the repo into your gitbash or terminal. In order to do any of this you also need VS Code. package.json and package-lock.json are already installed in this file so you shouldn't have to do it yourself. But if for whatever reason they don't install correctly just type 'npm i' in your terminal. As well as 'npm install inquirer'.

## Usage 

This app is designed to make SVG logos and also run a jest test to verify if the correct colors were picked. To run the app go to the terminal and type 'node index.js'. Follow the prompts. There will then be a new logo file that generates under the name svg.logo.
